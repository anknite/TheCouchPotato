The Couch Potato is a mini content management system for creating websites pertaining to maintaining information about various movie titles.

It was created as part of a college assignment by Ankit Gadgil and Sayak Sarkar, students of Symbiosis Institute of Computer Studies and Research.


Features:-
	  A. The Couch Potato was created on the Linux platform using HTML, PHP and MySQL as the base technologies. 
	  B. It recognizes three types of users, namely: anonymous user, registered user and the administrator.
	  C. The main page has six main areas:-

		1. Title Area:	   It is where the site's title is displayed along with the site logo in jpg format.

		2. Login Area:	   This area contains the user login options, i.e., text areas for an user to enter his/her username and 
				   password along with login and reset buttons.

		3. Navigation Bar: The Navigation Bar consists of links for the various content categories. The categories can be changed 
				   as per the site's requirements by the site administrator. The contents of the Navigation Bar can be 
				   changed as per the system's requirements and can accomodate six major categories.

		4. Side Bar: 	   The Side Bar consists of various options as per the user logged in:-

				    a. For an anonymous user not logged into the system, the sidebar displays three primary links:- 
					i. Home:   	    Link to the site's home page.
				       ii. Genres: 	    Composite link, which expands further to provide a list of movie genres, each 
							    contains links to show movies that belong to that particular genre.
				      iii. About:  	    Link to site's help file, which consists of a detailed description of the site.

				    b. For a registered user logged into the system, the sidebar displays five primary links:- 
				  	i. Home:            Link to the site's home page.
				       ii. Add New Content: Link to the system's content creation page. The content creation page allows 
							    the user to add a new content, by providing the user with a blank form, in 
							    which the details about the new content can be filled up.
				      iii. Genres: 	    Composite link, which expands further to provide a list of movie genres, each 
							    contains links to show movies that belong to that particular genre.
				       iv. About: 	    Link to site's help file, which consists of a detailed description of the site.
				  	v. Logout: 	    Link for the user to log out from the system.

				    c. For the system administrator, the sidebar displays six primary links:- 
				  	i. Home: 	    Link to the site's home page.
				       ii. Add New Content: Link to the system's content creation page. The content creation page allows 
							    the administrator to add new content, by providing the administrator with a 
							    blank form, in which the details about the new content can be filled up.
				      iii. Genres: 	    Composite link, which expands further to provide a list of movie genres, each 
							    containing links to show movies that belong to that particular genre.
				       iv. Administer: 	    Another composite link which provides a list of two secondary links namely: 
							    Genres & Categories, and Configure Site. The Genres & Categories link takes 
							    the administrator to the Genres & Categories modification page, where the 
							    administrator can create, rename or delete genres and categories as per the 
							    needs of the system.
				  	v. About:           Link to site's help file, which consists of a detailed description of the site.
				       vi. Logout:          Link for the administrator to log out from the system.


Data Structure:-

The Couch Potato stores all system data in a MySQL database, in the form of tables and relationships. The relationships among the tables are maintained by using Primary Key - Foreign Key Relations. 

The tables used by the system are as follows:-
	1. category
	2. content
	3. genre
	4. image
	5. user

The table descriptions are as follows:-
